	"description": "A variant method of rolling tests in WFRP4e: Roll 3x 1d100 and use the middle value. This produces a curved distribution such that easy things become easier and hard things become harder. This method produces a moderate curve that is not as severe as a normal distribution. It is also relatively easy to perform manually without doing a lot of math or changing a bunch of rules.",
